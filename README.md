# 🌟 Pathfinding Visualizer 🌟

Welcome to **Pathfinding Visualizer**! I built this application because I was fascinated by pathfinding algorithms and wanted to visualize them in action. I hope you enjoy playing around with this tool as much as I enjoyed building it!

## 🎯 Supported Algorithms

This application supports the following pathfinding algorithms:

### 🔍 Dijkstra's Algorithm (Weighted)
- **Description:** The father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path.
- **Key Feature:** Always finds the shortest path.

### 🌟 A* Search (Weighted)
- **Description:** Arguably the best pathfinding algorithm; uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm.
- **Key Feature:** Combines the power of Dijkstra with heuristics for optimal efficiency.

### 🚀 Greedy Best-first Search (Weighted)
- **Description:** A faster, more heuristic-heavy version of A*; does not guarantee the shortest path.
- **Key Feature:** Prioritizes speed over accuracy.

### 🐝 Swarm Algorithm (Weighted)
- **Description:** A mixture of Dijkstra's Algorithm and A*; does not guarantee the shortest path.
- **Key Feature:** Balances exploration and exploitation.

### 🔄 Convergent Swarm Algorithm (Weighted)
- **Description:** The faster, more heuristic-heavy version of Swarm; does not guarantee the shortest path.
- **Key Feature:** Enhanced speed, less accuracy.

### ⚔️ Bidirectional Swarm Algorithm (Weighted)
- **Description:** Swarm from both sides; does not guarantee the shortest path.
- **Key Feature:** Attack the problem from both ends.

### 🌐 Breath-first Search (Unweighted)
- **Description:** A great algorithm; guarantees the shortest path.
- **Key Feature:** Explores all possible paths equally.

### 🌀 Depth-first Search (Unweighted)
- **Description:** A very bad algorithm for pathfinding; does not guarantee the shortest path.
- **Key Feature:** Explores deep paths first, often leading to inefficiencies.

## 🎨 Maze Generation

On top of the pathfinding algorithms listed above, I implemented a **Recursive Division Maze Generation** algorithm, which adds an extra layer of complexity and fun to the visualization!
